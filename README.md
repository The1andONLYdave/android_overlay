Current Version 1.0
===============
What's this?
It's sort of a reminder like "ok make a break from your phone" before you spend way too much time on fb, candycrush, 2048...

===============
State:
Works on some phones/android versions, on others it just shows the overlay fully transparent making the user like "wtf? my touchscreen won't response any more, only notification bar..." this needs fixing.
It should be an overlay no activity, first we dont want the user to press back (and forget to make a break) to continue gaming or whatoever.
and it should never be fully transparent... maybe 50%, so you can (example in firefox) read finish the current sentence/screen/message and then make a break.

Needs a button on overlay for accessing settings(Preferences)Screen.
Needs to open settings at first start.
maybe display tutorial till "don't show on every start"

===============
think this could be a great app, but needs some good marketing/explaining-graphics and so on.

fork if you like, and use something like MIT, GPLv3, Apache 2 License... mentioned me (and dropping me a mail) would be nice, pull requests too and look for included library licenses like in https://github.com/The1andONLYdave/android_overlay/blob/master/android_overlay/src/com/jawsware/core/share/OverlayView.java (Apache License 2.0)
